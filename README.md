# Firefox Extension for AWS SSO

[日本語の説明はこちら](./README_ja.md)

This extension is for AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO). As for now, you will see what am I using Account Name and Permission Set for current console at AWS console's header. And then, AWS console header's color will almost be red if account name has 'Production' in it.
